# dev-loop — Config schema

Current dev-loop config lives in a workspace-local **`dev-loop.json`** using the 1.x workspace
schema. A workspace is one directory, one team, one backend, and the source of truth for every
repo/project the team runs.

The authoritative implementation lives in [`hub/src/team-config.ts`](../hub/src/team-config.ts);
this file is the operator-facing field reference.

## Discovery

Any dev-loop command resolves the workspace in this order:

1. `DEVLOOP_WORKSPACE` — absolute path to the workspace.
2. `DEVLOOP_TEAM` — team key resolved through the rebuildable `~/.dev-loop/workspaces.json` index.
3. Cwd ascent — walk upward to the first directory containing a valid `dev-loop.json`.

The index is only a convenience. The workspace folder itself is portable: copy it to another
machine, export the same env vars, run `dev-loop team repair`, then `dev-loop doctor`.

## Top-Level Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | Internal schema marker. Current 1.x workspace configs use `2`. |
| `workspaceId` | Workspace fingerprint: a random id `team init` mints once and keeps stable (even across `--force` re-init). On `backend:"linear"`, `add-project`/`sync-project` stamp it into the Linear project description as `[dev-loop:workspace:<id>]`; a foreign marker means another workspace already drives that project and dev-loop warns loudly instead of double-driving it. Unknown/extra top-level keys are tolerated, so older CLIs read fingerprinted configs unchanged. |
| `team` | Team-wide backend, deploy ceiling, communication channel, reports defaults, and steward-agent launch defaults. |
| `repos` | Physical registry of git clones. Each repo is registered once and may be referenced by multiple projects. |
| `projects` | Virtual delivery units. A project references one or more repos and owns strategy/test/agent behavior. |

## `team`

The `team set` column marks the fields `dev-loop team set <path> <value>` may update (the validated
single-field mutator; see [Operator-tunable fields](#operator-tunable-fields-dev-loop-team-set)).

| Field | Meaning | `team set` |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | Stable team key, `^[a-z0-9-]{2,32}$`. | — |
| `backend` | `"linear"` or `"service"`. One backend per team. | — |
| `linearTeam` / `linearTeamId` | Linear team name/id for `backend:"linear"`. | ✓ `team.linearTeam` |
| `deployPolicy` | Per-environment ceiling. `manual` means no repo may auto-deploy that environment. | — |
| `docSystem` / `docs` | Where team/product docs live. | — |
| `comms` | Slack/Lark channel config. Store env var names only. | ✓ `team.comms.provider`, `team.comms.webhookEnv` |
| `mode` | Default `"live"` / `"dry-run"` for projects that do not override. | ✓ `team.mode` |
| `autonomy` | Default autonomy posture for projects that do not override. | — |
| `intake` | Team-wide default intake block (`mode`, `todoDepthCap`); seeded by `team init --intake-mode`. Projects override **field-wise** (nearest wins per field), so a project tuning only `todoDepthCap` keeps a team-level `"passive"`. | ✓ `team.intake.mode`, `team.intake.todoDepthCap` |
| `defaultCodingAgent` | Default executor CLI (`claude`, `codex`, or `opencode`) when an agent does not override. | — |
| `codingAgentDefaults` | Default `{ model, effort }` per executor CLI. | — |
| `hub.agentInterface` | `backend:"service"` only: per coding agent, how a fire reaches the hub board — `"cli"` (the PATH-installed `dev-loop` write verbs; identity rides the fire env) or `"mcp"` (the scheduler-injected `dev-loop-hub` MCP server). Defaults: `claude`/`codex` → `"cli"` (codex since its 2026-07-11 P8 env-propagation certification, docs/PORTABILITY.md §4), `opencode` → `"mcp"`. This is also the rollback switch: set `"claude": "mcp"` / `"codex": "mcp"` to restore the injected-MCP behavior. Projects override per coding agent. | — |
| `agents` | Team-scope agent launch config, mainly cadence for Sweep/Ops/Reflect/Communication. | — |

## `repos`

`repos.<ref>` describes physical repo facts. These facts live on the repo registry, not on each
project, so a shared repo has one build/deploy truth.

| Field | Meaning | `team set` |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | Workspace-relative repo path. Must stay inside the workspace. | — |
| `remote` | Optional clone source for repair/sync. | — |
| `owner` | Required when a repo is referenced by more than one project. Used for ops/alert routing. | — |
| `landing` | `"direct"` or `"pr"`. | — |
| `autoMerge` | In PR mode, whether Dev may merge its own green PR. | — |
| `mergeChecks` | Required PR check contexts/job names. | — |
| `build` | Typecheck/build/test gates. | — |
| `deploy` | Command or release-PR deploy shape. | ✓ `repos.<ref>.deploy.style`, `.deploy.healthCheck`, `.deploy.environments.<env>.{auto,deployPrPrefix,command,healthCheck}` |
| `ops` | Health checks, critical routes, and read-only logs command for Ops. | — |

`dev-loop team add-repo <ref> --project <key> --path <rel> --detect` fills the detectable fields
deterministically (no LLM): it clones from `--remote` when the path is missing, maps `package.json`
scripts named `typecheck`/`build` to runner commands (runner chosen by lockfile: pnpm/yarn/npm), and
lists `.github/workflows` job names as candidate `mergeChecks`. It registers with `landing:"pr"` and
no auto-merge; interview-only fields (`deploy`, `ops`, `owner`) stay unset and `dev-loop doctor`
surfaces the gap. Explicit flags always beat detection.

## `projects`

`projects.<key>` is a virtual delivery unit. It points at repos, strategy, test environment, and
agent behavior.

| Field | Meaning | `team set` |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` removes the project from scheduling entirely — both delivery rotation and steward coverage. | ✓ `projects.<key>.enabled` |
| `weight` | Weighted round-robin share of delivery fires. `0` pauses delivery rotation only (maintenance mode) — stewards (sweep/ops/reflect/communication) keep covering the project. | ✓ `projects.<key>.weight` |
| `linearProject` / `linearProjectId` | Backend project name/id. | — |
| `strategyDoc` | Strategy document reference, usually `{ "path": "docs/STRATEGY.md" }`. | — |
| `testEnv` | Base URL, auth constraints, setup notes, and verification hints. | ✓ `projects.<key>.testEnv.baseUrl`, `.testEnv.authConstraint` |
| `intake.mode` | `"autonomous"` (default): PM proactively reviews the product/strategy doc and files its own work. `"passive"`: PM originates nothing — it only responds to explicit `needs-pm` intake (conventions §5a); verification, unblocking, and grooming are unchanged. Falls back to `team.intake` field-wise. | ✓ `projects.<key>.intake.mode` |
| `intake.todoDepthCap` | PM keeps committed `Todo` depth under this cap; default 10. | ✓ `projects.<key>.intake.todoDepthCap` |
| `devSplit` | `true` uses senior-dev + junior-dev. | ✓ `projects.<key>.devSplit` |
| `mode` / `autonomy` | Project overrides for team defaults. | — |
| `hub.agentInterface` | Project override of `team.hub.agentInterface`, merged **per coding agent** (a project flipping only `claude` keeps the team-level `codex` setting). | — |
| `agents` | Per-agent coding CLI, model, effort, and cadence overrides. | — |
| `reports` | Report sink and review-channel config. | — |
| `repos` | Repo references: `{ "ref": "...", "role": "primary" }`. | — |

## Operator-tunable fields (`dev-loop team set`)

```bash
dev-loop team set <path> <value>     # e.g. dev-loop team set team.mode live
```

A validated single-field update: the value is type-checked (enum/boolean/number/string per field), the
edit is applied to a copy, and the WHOLE file is re-validated before writing — `team set` can never
leave `dev-loop.json` invalid. Only the whitelisted paths above (`team set` ✓ columns) are accepted:

- `team.mode` (`dry-run`|`live`) · `team.linearTeam` · `team.comms.provider` (`slack`|`lark`) ·
  `team.comms.webhookEnv` · `team.intake.mode` (`autonomous`|`passive`) · `team.intake.todoDepthCap`
- `projects.<key>.enabled` · `.weight` · `.devSplit` · `.testEnv.baseUrl` · `.testEnv.authConstraint` ·
  `.intake.mode` · `.intake.todoDepthCap`
- `repos.<ref>.deploy.style` · `.deploy.healthCheck` ·
  `.deploy.environments.<env>.{auto,deployPrPrefix,command,healthCheck}`

Non-whitelisted paths are rejected with a pointer here: structural changes go through
`team add-project` / `team add-repo`, and interview fields are edited directly in `dev-loop.json`
(validated by `dev-loop doctor`). Setting `team.linearTeam` on a linear backend also re-runs the
workspace-fingerprint mismatch check against every mapped Linear project.

## Validation

`dev-loop doctor` is read-only and reports these schema errors:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `E01` | Bad or missing `schemaVersion`. |
| `E02` | Bad `team.key` or unsupported backend. |
| `E03` | Repo path is missing, absolute, or escapes the workspace. |
| `E04` | Project references an unknown repo ref. |
| `E05` | Shared repo lacks a valid `owner`. |
| `E06` | Repo auto-deploys an env pinned to `manual` by `deployPolicy`. |
| `E07` | Bad comms provider or webhook env var name; URLs are rejected. |
| `E08` | Bad `enabled` / `weight`. |
| `E10` | Duplicate repo paths or duplicate `linearProjectId`. |
| `E11` | Reserved/invalid project key or repo ref. `_team` is the hub-only intake row (seeded by `team init` into hub.db) and is rejected as a config project. |
| `E12` | Bad `intake` block: `mode` not `"autonomous"`/`"passive"`, or `todoDepthCap` not a positive integer. |
| `E13` | Bad `hub` block: `agentInterface` key not a known coding agent (`claude`/`codex`/`opencode` — typos would silently not apply), or a value other than `"cli"`/`"mcp"`. |

Common warnings:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `E09` | Linear backend with a blank `linearTeam`. Since 1.2 this is a load-time **warning**, not an error — `team init --backend linear --yes` writes it blank on purpose, and the workspace must stay loadable so `dev-loop team set team.linearTeam "<Name>"` can repair it. The hard failure moved to launch time: `dev-loop run` (and anything projecting the runtime config) refuses with `[E09]` until it is filled. |
| `W01` | Project has no repos. |
| `W02` | Repo is referenced by nobody. |
| `W03` | Lessons INDEX/shard is over budget. |
| `W04` | Project sync is stale. |
| `W05` | Linear steward fires need the Linear MCP in user scope. |
| `W06` | Workspace root is inside a git worktree and `.dev-loop/` is not ignored. |
| `W07` | Deployed repo has no health probe for Ops. |
| `W08` | Service workspace: a config project has no hub.db row — its fires get no board access (the scheduler skips it at pick time); run the printed `dev-loop seed` command. |
| `W09` | Service workspace with `interface:"cli"` agents: `dev-loop` is not runnable on PATH — those fires have no board access. Install it: `npm i -g @dyzsasd/dev-loop`. |
| `W10` | The PATH-installed `dev-loop` predates the CLI write layer (needs >= 1.2.0) — `interface:"cli"` fires cannot write the board. Upgrade the global install. |
| `W11` | Identity smoke failed: `dev-loop project` exited non-zero under a fire-shaped env (`DEVLOOP_ACTOR`/`DEVLOOP_PROJECT`/`DEVLOOP_HUB_DB`) — the CLI fails closed, so every `interface:"cli"` fire would boot with no board access. |

## State Layout

Everything runtime-related lives under `<workspace>/.dev-loop/`:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `<project>/` | Per-project state, reports, runner logs, and agent working files. |
| `team/` | Team-scope steward state, rotation cursor, `fires.jsonl`. |
| `lessons/` | Team lessons index, shards, and archive. |
| `wt/<ticket>/<repo>/` | Worktrees. |
| `locks/` | Repo/team locks. |
| `hub.db` | Service backend system of record. |
| `daemon.json` | Service hub daemon runfile. |

`~/.dev-loop/` keeps only the rebuildable workspace index.

## Commands

| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `dev-loop install-claude-plugin` | Register the npm-backed Claude Code plugin marketplace and print the two interactive `/plugin` commands. |
| `dev-loop team init` | Create a workspace. Pure CLI: no LLM and no backend calls. Mints the `workspaceId` fingerprint. |
| `dev-loop team set <path> <value>` | Validated single-field update over the whitelisted operator-tunable paths (see above). |
| `dev-loop team add-project <key>` | Validated project write. On `backend:"service"` it also auto-seeds the hub.db row (find-or-create; `--name`/`--prefix` override the derived hub name/ticket prefix). On `backend:"linear"` with `--linear-project-id` it stamps the workspace fingerprint. |
| `dev-loop team add-repo <ref>` | Validated repo write. `--detect` clones if needed and fills build/CI facts deterministically. |
| `dev-loop team repair` | Repair worktrees/index/WAL after a move. |
| `dev-loop doctor` | Read-only workspace verdict. Ends with a `NEXT:` line — the single most-blocking next step (fix config → fill `linearTeam` → add-project → seed → add-repo → flip `team.mode` → `dev-loop run`). |
| `dev-loop run` | Schedule the team from the workspace config. |
| `dev-loop hub start|stop|status|ensure` | Manage the workspace service hub daemon; normal 1.x lifecycle for `backend:"service"`. |
| `/dev-loop:add-project` | Coding-CLI skill that syncs backend project/labels and writes project config. |
| `/dev-loop:add-repo` | Coding-CLI skill that clones/detects/registers repo config. |
| `/dev-loop:sync-project` | Reconcile config vs backend project drift. |
| `/dev-loop:sync-repo` | Re-detect repo build/deploy/remote drift. |

Low-level compatibility/debugging commands such as `dev-loop daemon ...`, `seed`,
`init-service`, `serve`, and `mcp-merge` are intentionally not the first-run path for new
workspaces.

## Troubleshooting Map

| Signal | Meaning | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| `/dev-loop:*` commands are missing in Claude Code | The dev-loop plugin is not installed or the session has not refreshed. | Run `dev-loop install-claude-plugin`, execute the printed `/plugin` commands, then restart/refresh Claude Code. |
| `E09` warning / `dev-loop run` refuses with `[E09]` | `team.linearTeam` is blank (e.g. `team init --backend linear --yes`). | Run `dev-loop team set team.linearTeam "<Team Name>"`, then rerun `dev-loop doctor`. |
| `W05` | Linear steward fires need the Linear MCP in user scope. | Configure Linear MCP in Claude Code user scope, then rerun `dev-loop doctor`. |
| `W06` | `.dev-loop/` may be committed by accident. | Add `.dev-loop/` to the workspace repo's ignore rules. |
| `W09`/`W10`/`W11` | The CLI-interface preflight failed — `interface:"cli"` fires depend on a current, identity-resolving `dev-loop` on PATH. | `npm i -g @dyzsasd/dev-loop@latest`, then rerun `dev-loop doctor`; a persistent `W11` means the fire env cannot resolve project/actor (check the printed stderr). |
| Service hub has no URL | Daemon is stopped or cwd/workspace resolution failed. | Run `dev-loop hub ensure && dev-loop hub status` from the workspace root. |

## Security Notes

- Secrets never live in `dev-loop.json`; store env var names only.
- `team.comms.webhookEnv` must be an env var name, not a URL.
- Inline webhook/secret literals are rejected from workspace config.
- Copying the workspace folder should never copy credentials.
